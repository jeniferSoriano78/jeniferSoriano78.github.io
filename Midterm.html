  <h1> This is my Midterm:</h1>
  <p> I wrote about the Abuse of elderly in nursing homes because surprisingly enough it is happening more often then it should be and although there are rules that restricts this,
  there is actually no law that prohibits them from doing it in the first place. As well as there is no strict requirement in people who are taking care of these elderlies. So I want to spread awareness
  about the risk and dangers of sending our loved ones into a retirement home or nursing home.The styles I used in photoshop is torn paper effect,color splash effect, and bleding texture
  background.An illustrator i use a text style called Friday night lights, as well as logo creation. </p>
